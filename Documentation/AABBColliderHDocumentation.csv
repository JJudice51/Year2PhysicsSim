class AABBColliderComponent : public ColliderComponent,This class is a chilc class of ColliderComponent.
,
public:,
"AABBColliderComponent(float width, float height) : ColliderComponent() { m_width = width; m_height = height; setColliderType(AABB); }",this is the contructor for a AABBColliderComponent.
GamePhysics::Collision* checkCollisionCircle(CircleColliderComponent* other) override,this function is called when a collision with a circle collider is detected and is overridden from the base class.
GamePhysics::Collision* checkCollisionAABB(AABBColliderComponent* other) override;,this function is called when a collision with an AABB collider is detected and is overridden from the base class.
void draw() override;,this function is called when an AABB collider is needed to be drawn in the scene and is overridden form the base class.
float getWidth() {return m_width;},grabs and returns the width of the AABB collider.
float getHeight() {return m_height;},grabs and returns the height of the AABB collider.
float getRadius() {return m_radius;},grabs and returns the radius of the AABB collider.
,
private:,
float m_width;,the horizontal measurement or distance measured from side to side.
float m_height;,the measurement of the distance of an object from the base to the top.
float m_radius;,the line segment that runs from the center of the rectangle/square to any one of its vertices.
